"""Turn the smartness matrix's raw rows into its wiki page.

    python3 benchmark/capital_of_paris_report.py results.jsonl > \
        .qwen/wiki/Capital-of-Paris-Smartness.md

The page is wiki content, not a repository document: it is a measurement
report, and the repository keeps the tooling that produces it (this script and
`capital_of_paris_smartness.py`) plus the gitignored raw rows.

Reads the JSONL that `capital_of_paris_smartness.py` writes: one object per
(model, prompt, repeat). Groups by (label, quant, engine, prompt), reports the
mean and range of TTFT, decode rate and load across repeats, and says how many
repeats answered in `content` -- the column that matters for a model that
thinks with the switch off.

Every number in the tables comes from the rows. The prose around them is fixed
and says which session's rows it is describing, because the honest comparison
across sessions (the 167 s outlier, the cold load) is not derivable from one
file.

Rows that predate `repeat`/`content_chars` still render: the fields are derived
when missing, so an archived file can be regenerated rather than lost.
