# Cutting an TinyTitan release

This is the runbook for turning a green `main` into a tagged, published release
with prebuilt binaries. It exists because the sequence has traps that cost time
and one that can publish the wrong thing. `CONTRIBUTING.md` has the short
version; this file is the one to follow, including what to do when it stalls.

Every release is a **tag and a published GitHub Release with binaries**. The
mechanism is `tools/release.sh`, the shape is the previous release, and the
release notes are `docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md`.

## 0. What you need before starting

| Check | Command | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 26+, Swift 6.4+ | `sw_vers`, `swift --version` | The runtime's floor; the release notes state it |
| Disk | `df -h .` | A clean scratch build plus the staged archive wants ~10 GB |
| Memory | `memory_pressure -Q` | The golden baselines load real models |
| **No model process** | `pgrep -fl 'TinyTitanServer\|TinyTitanMac\|TinyTitanDecodeService\|TinyTitanCLI\|TinyTitanPackageTests\|swiftpm-testing-helper\|mlx_lm\|mlx-lm'` | The golden gate refuses to run beside one; see §5 |
| `gh` authenticated | `gh auth status` | Publishing uses it; it must be the repo owner's account |
| A release build exists | `ls .build/release/TinyTitanCLI` | The golden gate drives that binary and runs *before* the clean scratch build; `release.sh` refuses to start without it |
| The installs to verify | `ls models/*/verified-install.json` | The gate verifies only what is installed, and never fetches a model; see §5 |
| Clean tree, HEAD on the tag | `git status --porcelain` | `release.sh` enforces both |

Never terminate a process you did not start. If one of these is alive and not
yours, stop and ask the human — §5 is the long version.

## 1. Prepare the version

> **The version standard is `X.Y` — two components.** This repository is TinyTitan
> Datacenter, `v1.0.0` is released, and **the next release is `1.1`**. There is no patch
> component: `1.1` is a version and `1.1.1` is a defect, so there is nothing to decide
> about a third number at release time. The notes file, the changelog heading, the tag
> and the archive name are all `X.Y`.

Three places, and only the first is a literal:

1. **`tools/install_tinytitan.sh`** — `CFBundleVersion` and
   `CFBundleShortVersionString` in the app bundle it writes. That is the only
   version literal in the tree. Grep for the previous version before believing
   this: `grep -rn "5\.1\b" --include="*.sh" --include="*.swift" sources/ tools/`.
2. **The wiki `Changelog.md`** (`.qwen/wiki/Changelog.md`) — a new `## X.Y — <headline>`
   section at the top, with `[Release vX.Y](https://github.com/Pummelchen/TinyTitan/releases/tag/vX.Y)`
   and user-facing bullets. Keep it compact: what a *user* can do now that they
   could not before, and the numbers that back it.
3. **`README.md`** — **no release callout.** The README is the stable front
   page: what TinyTitan is, the benchmark table, the supported-model list and the
   links. A version's announcement belongs in the wiki `Changelog.md` above, so a
   reader finds it once instead of the README accumulating a section per release.
   The README changes only when a fact it states changes — a new benchmark row, a
   model joining or leaving the supported list — and the only version string in
   the tree is the installer literal below.

The dated `docs/site/*.md` articles say "at the time of writing" and are **not**
bumped: they record when they were verified, and re-stamping them without
re-verifying would be a false claim.

## 2. Write the release notes

`docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md`, modelled on the previous one:

- a `## TinyTitan Datacenter X.Y — <headline>` title, then one paragraph saying what the
  release is for;
- one `###` section per user-visible change, each naming the check that backs
  it (a gate, a measurement, a real-model run);
- `### Also in this release` for the smaller items;
- `### Performance` — only numbers measured on *this* commit, and say plainly
  when a previous table was not re-run;
- a final section:

  ```
  ### Checksum

  `tinytitan-X.Y-macos-arm64.tar.gz` sha256: `SHA256_PENDING`
  `tinytitan-X.Y-macos-arm64.tar.gz` size: `ARCHIVE_BYTES_PENDING` bytes
  ```

Neither placeholder is one to forget: `release.sh --publish` substitutes both
with the archive it just built, and **refuses to publish unless the notes carry
the placeholder or quote the real value** for each. A release whose notes quote
the wrong digest is worse than one quoting none — 3.7 shipped that way for a few
minutes — and a size copied out of a dry run is wrong for the same reason, because
the publish pass rebuilds from scratch and the archive differs. 5.4's notes
quoted the dry run's 24,770,128 bytes for an archive that published at
24,770,200, which is why the size has a placeholder too.

The last two sections are a claim about what was verified. Do not write a gate
result you have not seen; add it after the dry run if you want it in the notes.

#### The Release page carries the compact form

`release.sh` runs `tools/compact-release-notes.py` over the rendered notes and
publishes the result, so the Release page is bullets — one sentence each, wrapped
narrow — while `docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md` stays the full record of why each
change exists and how it was checked.

The compactor only re-lays-out; it never rewords, so **it cannot make a long
draft short**. That is what the budget is for: the compact form must come in
under `TINYTITAN_RELEASE_NOTES_MAX_CHARS` (default 12000) or the run stops. Write
the notes compactly to begin with — bullets over paragraphs, the claim first and
the elaboration only where it changes the claim.

It also fails when compaction would drop a string `--publish` needs — every
unchecked baseline, the digest, the byte count — which is the whole point of
running it in the build rather than trusting the transformation: an omission is
caught before the Release exists instead of after it is public.

Both checks run whenever `--notes` is given, including the dry run, so a budget
or coverage failure costs a notes edit rather than a full gate run.

Note that the tag still holds whatever was committed at cut time. Editing the
notes afterwards — to shorten them, say — moves `main` and the Release page, and
cannot move the tag without rewriting it, which is not done.

## 3. Commit, tag, push

The annotated tag's message is the starting point for the notes, so make it the
headline plus the lead paragraph.

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Prepare X.Y: release notes, the changelog entry, and the app version"
git push origin main
git tag -a vX.Y -m "TinyTitan X.Y — <headline>

<lead paragraph>"
git push origin vX.Y
```

Push the wiki's Changelog too (`git -C .qwen/wiki commit && git -C .qwen/wiki push`).
`release.sh` requires HEAD to *be* the tag and the tag to be *pushed*; a tag
that exists only locally fails the precondition with a clear message.

## 4. Dry run, then publish

```bash
tools/release.sh vX.Y                     # verify, build, stage — no publish
tools/release.sh vX.Y --publish --notes docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md
```

The dry run is the default because publishing notifies watchers. Read its
output; then look at `.build/releases/tinytitan-release-X.Y/` — the staged tree and
the tarball — before re-running with `--publish`.

What the dry run does, in order:

1. **Preconditions** — clean tree, `vX.Y` exists locally, HEAD is that commit,
   the tag is on `origin`, and no Release for it exists yet.
2. **Gates** — `tools/lint.sh`; `swift test --no-parallel`, which must print
   `Test run with N tests in M suites passed`; then **every installed model that
   has a golden target** (`benchmark/golden/`), each through
   `tools/golden-baseline.sh --check <target>`.
3. **A clean scratch build** — `swift build -c release --scratch-path
   .build/releases/.../build`, with the log scanned for compiler warnings. It is
   deliberately not an incremental build: an incremental one compiles nothing
   and the warning gate passes vacuously.
4. **Stage and package** — the six executables, the `.bundle` resources (the
   Metal shader library — the runtime cannot load kernels without them), the
   licence and notices, `README-binaries.txt`, then the tarball and its
   `.sha256`.

`release.sh` requires HEAD to *be* the tag, so if a commit landed on `main`
after tagging (a documentation fix is the usual reason), run the release from
the tag itself — the binaries are built from the tagged commit either way:

```bash
git checkout vX.Y          # detached HEAD on the tag
tools/release.sh vX.Y      # then --publish
git checkout main
```

`--publish` repeats all of that and then creates the Release with `--repo`
pinned. Every `gh` call is pinned because in a fork `gh` defaults to the
*parent* repository: `gh release list` would show another project's releases and
`gh release create` fails with a misleading "tag has not been pushed".

## 4b. Internal-speed benchmark (mandatory)

Every release records the engine's own speeds and compares them with the
previous release's record. This is the step that catches a speed regression —
a kernel that got slower, a bandwidth that dropped, prefill or decode that
traded throughput away — before anyone experiences it. It is data collection,
not a performance claim: do not put a ceiling in the notes.

```bash
# on the release machine, with the release build and the 4B install present
tools/internal-speeds.py --record --label vX.Y \
  --baseline benchmark/internal-speeds/<previous>.json
```

It measures GPU kernel bandwidth (QKV GEMV, routed MoE, GDN in-projection), CPU
int8 affine GEMV bandwidth, prefill and decode tok/s, time to first token, the
effective decode bandwidth, and a quality proxy on the fixed prompt
*"difference swift vs c++ in detail"*. The full field list is in
`benchmark/internal-speeds/README.md`.

**Records are per (model, prompt).** The mandatory record is the 4B; an ANE
prefill number exists for any install whose family the sidecar exporter can
describe — the qwen36 MoE family and the dense Qwen 3.5 family, since the
exporter now reads its geometry from the model's manifest. Record such an
install as an additional record when a sidecar is present:

```bash
tools/internal-speeds.py --record --label vX.Y-<model> \
  --model models/<install with a sidecar>
```

The one family the ANE does not serve at all is the one-layer MTP draft: the
runtime verifies it rather than prefilling it on the Neural Engine, so the record
says so rather than quoting a number. Sparse-indexed attention is *not* an
exception any more — Qwen 3.8's QSA indexer selects keys rather than changing the
arithmetic, and the runtime folds that selection into the additive mask the
sidecar already takes — but it is also **not installed**: measured, the ANE runs
0.72× the GPU's prefill on that model, so its row reports the measurement instead
of a speedup. The ANE also requires a 4,096-token prefill chunk and a prompt that
fills one; a model left on a smaller chunk cannot reach it at all.

With no `--baseline`, the comparison picks the newest previous record for the
**same model and prompt**, so extra records never become the 4B's baseline. A
model with no install is reported **not checked** — never fetched to fill a row.
An ANE row with no sidecar is recorded not applicable, with the reason.

**The gate:** the command exits non-zero when any bandwidth or tokens-per-second
metric regressed by more than 10%, or when TTFT/decode/total seconds rose by
more than 10% (`--threshold` to change it). A non-zero exit blocks the release
until the regression is fixed or explained in `### Verification` in the notes
with the metric, both values and the reason. A *changed* greedy response hash is
reported as a note, not a failure — a deliberate numerics change moves it, and
`### Verification` should say so.

Commit the new `benchmark/internal-speeds/<label>.json` with the release. Do
not overwrite an older record: the diff against it is the point, and the record
is only valid for one (machine, build, model) triple. If the 4B install is
absent, the step is reported as **not checked** like a missing golden — never
"fixed" by installing a model for it, and never skipped silently.

## 5. When a golden gate refuses (the trap that looks like a failure)

If the log shows this, **no golden was compared**:

```
refusing to start: these processes match the model-process guard
  91687 .../swiftpm-testing-helper --test-bundle-path .../WebTransport...
stop them yourself, or re-run when they are gone. This script never terminates a process it did not start.
error: golden baseline mismatch (qwen38-4)
```

`release.sh` reports the refusal as `golden baseline mismatch (<target>)`,
because its helper exits non-zero for both. Check the line above it: a real
mismatch prints an output diff instead. Do not re-capture a baseline to make
this go away — the baseline is valid for one (machine, build, model) triple.

The common blocker on a shared machine is another project's
`swiftpm-testing-helper` (a Dropbox-resident checkout, in this workspace). It
can be a *loop* that respawns every couple of minutes; the guard is re-checked
by **each** golden invocation, so a loop with a 40% duty cycle means the phase
cannot complete. What to do:

1. Tell the human which process is blocking, with its parent and how long it
   has been alive (`ps -o pid,ppid,etime,%cpu -p <pid>`).
2. Ask them to stop it, or wait for it to finish. Never terminate it yourself,
   and never `pkill` by pattern.
3. When the machine has been quiet for ~90 s, re-run the dry run.

Waiting for a *single* short gap is not enough: the gate must start cleanly once
for every golden in the list. Verify a real quiet window before spending another
attempt:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 6); do pgrep -f 'swiftpm-testing-help[e]r' >/dev/null && echo busy || echo quiet; sleep 30; done
```

### Only the installs already in `models/` are verified

`models/` is deliberately kept below the full supported set — it is hundreds of
gigabytes and the operator prunes it to save disk. The golden phase therefore
verifies **every golden target that has an install there, and nothing else**, and
says out loud which ones it could not check:

```
  -- NOT CHECKED golden baseline ornith-4 (ornith-1.5_35B_A3B_4Bit): no install under models/
  4 golden baseline(s) identical
  NOT CHECKED — no install in models/, and none may be fetched to fix that: ornith-8 ornith-4 qwen36-4 qwen36-8 agentworld-4 agentworld-8
  the release notes must name every baseline that was not checked
```

**A missing install is never resolved by downloading, converting, repacking or
re-installing a model.** No release step fetches a model: `release.sh`
fingerprints the install set under `models/` — every top-level entry by name,
type, size and mtime, plus every receipt's bytes — before the golden phase and
fails if any of it changed, so a gate cannot quietly install one to go green.
(That is deliberately not a payload hash: hashing 461 GB is not a gate, and the
receipt the runtime verifies is what attests the payload.) A release that would
need a model the machine does not have waits for the
operator to install it deliberately — that is the
[adding-a-model](adding-a-model.md) runbook, and it is a decision, not a
side-effect of cutting a release.

`--publish` refuses unless the notes name **every** target that was not checked,
absent ones included. That is the whole point: a reader of the Release learns
what was and was not re-verified, and "not checked, no install" is a different
sentence from "checked and byte-identical".

An installed model that no `check_golden` line covers is a hard error rather than
a silent omission, so a model cannot join the fleet unchecked. An intentional
exception is declared, with its reason, in `NON_GOLDEN_INSTALLS` in
`tools/release.sh`: today that is only the MTP draft head, a sidecar a covered
target's baseline already exercises. (The dense Qwen 3.5 2B/4B/9B used to be
listed here because they had no stored baseline at all, so a release verified
them through neither path. They have targets of their own now —
`qwen35-{2b,4b,9b}-{4,8}` — captured while the installs were present.) The guard
exists to catch the *undeclared* case, so add to that list deliberately, not to
silence it.

**A baseline can only be captured while its model is installed**, and `models/`
is pruned for disk. So the set the gate actually checks moves with what is on the
machine: a target with no install is reported as not checked (above), and its
stored file stays in the repository for whenever the install returns. Capture
while an install is present — that is the only window — and never delete a stored
baseline because its model is currently absent.

### A baseline the host cannot check at all (a documented skip)

Some installs live in a synced folder and the provider can leave them
**online-only**: the file lists its full size with zero blocks allocated, and a
read either blocks while it is fetched or fails outright. 5.3 hit this on a
machine where Dropbox had made seven installs online-only; every expert read
failed with

```
error: parallel expert read failed: Operation timed out
```

which surfaces through the gate as `mismatch (4)` and has nothing to do with
the runtime — `cat` on the file reproduces it, and `fileproviderctl evaluate
<path>` shows `isDownloaded = 0`. Materializing is the fix, but the largest
install needs 134 GB and the disk must hold *every* checked install at once, so
it can be impossible. Diagnose before concluding anything:

```bash
find models -type f -size +1M -exec stat -f "%b %z %N" {} \; |
  awk '$1*512 < $2*0.9 {print $3, $2}'        # online-only files, by size
```

Never delete a target from `check_golden`'s list to get past this: the list is
what stops a release from silently skipping an installed model. Name the target
instead, with its reason, and `release.sh` prints it in the golden phase and
**refuses to publish unless the notes repeat it**:

```bash
TINYTITAN_RELEASE_SKIP_GOLDENS=qwen38-8 \
TINYTITAN_RELEASE_SKIP_GOLDENS_REASON="install is Dropbox online-only; 134 GB needed, 123 GB free" \
  tools/release.sh v5.3
```

The env var is per-invocation and the reason is mandatory. The notes get a
`### Verification` sentence naming the target, the reason, and what *was*
checked — a release that says plainly which baseline went unverified is worth
more than one that implies all of them ran.

(Bracket the pattern — `help[e]r` — or `pgrep` matches the shell running it.)

## 6. After publishing

```bash
gh release view vX.Y --repo Pummelchen/TinyTitan --json url,assets \
  --jq '"\(.url) \([.assets[].name] | join(", "))"'
```

Check: the notes on the Release quote the digest in the archive's `.sha256`
next to it; the assets are the tarball and the checksum; the wiki Changelog
points at the same tag. The binaries are **not** signed or notarized, and
`README-binaries.txt` in the archive says so and tells the user how to clear the
quarantine attribute after verifying the checksum — keep that honest rather
than implying a notarized build.

If you wrote a `### Performance` table, make sure it says which commit and
machine it was measured on, and leave previous releases' tables alone.

## 7. Checklist

- [ ] Installer version bumped; no stale version literal left (`grep` for it)
- [ ] Wiki `Changelog.md` has the new section, pushed
- [ ] No release callout added to the README — the Changelog section **is** the
      announcement, and the README changed only if a fact in it changed
- [ ] `docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md` ends with a checksum block carrying
      `SHA256_PENDING` **and** `ARCHIVE_BYTES_PENDING` — never a size copied out
      of a dry run
- [ ] Tree clean, `git tag -a vX.Y`, tag pushed, `release.sh` preconditions pass
- [ ] A release build exists (`.build/release/TinyTitanCLI`) and
      `models/` holds exactly the installs you intend to verify
- [ ] Dry run green: lint, the serial suite, **every installed golden**, a
      warning-free clean build
- [ ] **Internal-speed benchmark recorded and compared** against the previous
      release (`tools/internal-speeds.py --record --label vX.Y --baseline …`);
      no metric past the 10% threshold, and the new record committed
- [ ] **No model was downloaded, converted, repacked or re-installed** to make a
      check run; the golden phase left `models/` byte-identical (`release.sh`
      enforces this)
- [ ] Every baseline that was not checked is named in `### Verification` — both
      the ones absent from `models/` and any skipped via
      `TINYTITAN_RELEASE_SKIP_GOLDENS` (`release.sh --publish` enforces this)
- [ ] The notes are compact: the Release page is bullets, and the compact form is
      under the `TINYTITAN_RELEASE_NOTES_MAX_CHARS` budget (`release.sh` compacts
      and enforces this on any run that passes `--notes`)
- [ ] Staged archive inspected (six executables, bundles, licence, notices)
- [ ] `--publish --notes docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md`, then `gh release view`
- [ ] No model process left running afterwards
